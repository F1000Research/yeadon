-include uncertainty calculations
-PAGE 69 OF YEADON'90-II: THE VALUES FOR THE LEFT AND RIGHT LIMBS ARE THEN AVERAGED SINCE THE SIMULATION MODEL IS DESIGNED TO HAVE SYMMETRICAL INERTIA VALUES
-units for everything? SI		
-USE THE CORRECT COORD SYSTEM: Z DOWN? (GLOBAL)

in soliddraw "warning invalid value encountered in divide"...

REVIEW FORMULAS FOR F1...etc

NEED TO REDO CALCULATIONS FOR NONCIRCLES

YEADON'S PAPER HAD AN ERROR: CHECK THIS STUFF


SCALE ALL ALPHA VALUES TO DENSITY

AS IT'S WRITTEN, ANGLES IS ALWAYS A LIST, NOT AN NP ARRAY. I MAY WANT TO CHANGE THIS

MUST DECIDE WHAT THE JOINT ANGLES ARE 

B = 1 FOR CIRCLES, BE VERY WARY OF THIS SIMPLIFICATION, IT MIGHT NOT BE VALID!!

IDEALLY I WANT A WAY OF JUST DESCRIBING THE KINEMATIC LINKAGES, AND THEN THE CODE CAN HANDLE THE PLOTTING ETC

location of hip centers is at (-t,0,0) and (t,0,0)

REPLACE ALL VARIABLES TO WORDS: L-->LEVEL etc, for readability
DIFFERENCES/NOTES/FIXES
-fixed body frame f is fixed in the pelvis
-fix for b = (t1-t0)/t0
-measurement differences
-neck calculation: i said it's a cylinder! =o
